* options menu
* save to file on quit (workaround for force close: save to localState, then check localState against file)
* keep settings in localstate
* text animations (speed up, slow down, force continue, force type)
* sprites
* picture load properly
* title > game fade animation
* write transpiler for game.js
* fix centering
