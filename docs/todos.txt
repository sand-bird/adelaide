* options menu
* save to file on quit (workaround for force close: save to localState, then check localState against file)
* keep settings in localstate
* text animations (speed up, slow down, force continue, force type)
* sprites
* title > game fade animation
* write transpiler for game.js
* remove delay on text appear when resuming from menu





? fix centering
X entering menu doesn't retype text
X picture load properly
X pagifyActions
X change pagifyActions to split based on the length of the actions' names
X switch to webpack i guess
